    <p>Scratch is a programming language that makes it easy to create your own
       interactive stories, animations, games, music, and art.</p>

    <p>As young people create and share Scratch projects, they learn important
       mathematical and computational ideas, while also learning to think creatively,
       reason systematically, and work collaboratively. Scratch is designed especially
       for ages 8 to 16, but is used by people of all ages.</p>
